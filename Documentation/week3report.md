# Weekly Report (Week 3)  
I'm Yuki Yotsumoto. This is the 3rd weekly report.

## Weekly outcome and advancements  
The time required this week was 15 hours. I made the program which does spell check with Damerau-leveshtein distance. I made the vocabulary which has been named "Programming_vocabulary.csv" to use as correctly-spelled words by myself*.  



## Unclear or problematic things  
- Do you know the words (espacially, related to programming terms) of csv, for example 'inf', 'class', and 'return'?

## Prospect -- what's next
