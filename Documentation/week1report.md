# Weekly Report (Week 1)
I'm Yuki Yotsumoto. This is the 1st weekly report.

## Weekly outcome and advancements
The time required this week was 15 hours.

I have written the project specification, which defines the theme of my project. I have set code analysis tool as my original theme because I am deeply interested in Education for computer engineers and the way to support programmers. In addition, I defined the structure of my project directory (shown on README.md).

Next, I could have follow detailed course schedule as of now. I have decided on a topic and programming language. When it comes to next week's schedule, I have to find out what/how to do unit test of my code before designing UI. This is because honestly, I do not think I fully understand what "unit tests" means. After that, I have to start to implement the UI and the core functionality.

## Unclear or problematic things
- Is there any specific recommendation way for researching itself or implementing unit test of my code? I'm asking this because I would like to get familiar with the way to do unit tests. And there might be difference with my understanding in my mother tongue (Japanese, neither English nor Finnish) to some extent.
- Is code documentation (JavaDoc or similar) the same as comments in the program? I have read the section explaining assessment, but I am not sure what code documentation means.

## Prospect -- what's next
There will be harder tasks to accomplish than this week by next Saturday, given the detailed schedule. Of course, I will submit 2nd weekly report and it would be ideal to start researching the common/good library, working on UI. Before moving on to the core functionality, I think I should think of the quick structure of my project.
