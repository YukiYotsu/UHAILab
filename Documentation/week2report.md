# Weekly Report (Week 2)  
I'm Yuki Yotsumoto. This is the 2nd weekly report.

## Weekly outcome and advancements  
The time required this week was 20 hours. It took about 10 hours to understand Poetry and unittest.

I learned what is docstring, which tells what my classes and methods do. And also, I understood how to write docstring appropriately along PEP 257.

```
# this is a comment.
""" this is docstring
"""
```
I'm not sure what is clearly different between comments and docstring, but as long as I look up, it is quite efficient and convenient to leave docstring when you need to documents generated automatically by Sphinx.

And I installed Poetry with no problem to handle automated tests and test coverage calculations. I have practiced the code examples on the page[1].

## Unclear or problematic things  
- May I ask what is 'tab completion'? When I installed Poetry, the instruction page[2] for installing has also the section named 'Enable tab completion for Bash, Fish, or Zsh' Do I have to do setting this as well?  
- According to "Poetry and dependency management" written by this course, I'll probably do something wrong by using pip. Is just avoiding the use of pip fine? because I have installed pip.  
- Should I place poetry directory at the same directory for my project? Or is it fine to place it anywhere?
