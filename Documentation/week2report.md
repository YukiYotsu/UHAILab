# Weekly Report (Week 2)
I'm Yuki Yotsumoto. This is the 2nd weekly report.

## Weekly outcome and advancements

I learned what is docstring, which tells what my classes and methods do. ThereAnd also,

```
# this is a comment.
""" this is docstring
"""
```
I'm not sure what is clearly different between comments and docstring, but as long as I look up, it is quite efficient and convenient to leave docstring when they need to documents generated automatically by Sphinx.
