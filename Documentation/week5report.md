# Weekly Report (Week 3)  
I'm Yuki Yotsumoto. This is the 5th weekly report.  

## Weekly outcome and advancements   
Approximately 20 hours required to proceed the project this week.  
I changed the vocabulary file into *Word frequency Top 5000*'s file to check if words are correctly-spelled. You can get access with the link (https://www.wordfrequency.info/) .　　
I have done coverage test newly.

## Unclear or problematic things  
- Do I have to change (re-write) my specification document because the core functions of my projects have been changed?  

## Prospect -- what's next  
I would like to improve my test's coverage rate to 80% on average and finish to write some documents properly.
