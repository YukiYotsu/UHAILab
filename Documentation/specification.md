# The Project Specification
Last modified: *14.01.2025*

My name is Yuki Yotsumoto. I belong to **Bachelor of Science in Computer Science** (CS) as an exchange student from Japan. All the project's documentation are written in **English markdown** (.md) language.

## Programming language used in this project
I would like to code with **Python** language in this project this time because it should be easy for many computer engineers to understand, given its easy grammar rule[1] and its popularity.

And as mentioned on the page of the course's details on other documentation, I would like to mention other language which I am good at to the extent that I can peer review projects. In addition to Python, I can do in **C** as well.

## What problem am I solving?
GRASP
If the code you have written does not produce expected results, you need to grasp what is wrong.
I focus on the fact that it's difficult for programming beginner to clarify the cause of some errors in program.
