# The Project Specification


## Programming language used in this project
I would like to code with **Python** language in this project this time because it should be easy for many computer engineers to understand, given its easy grammar rule[1] and its popularity.

And as mentioned at the course's details on other documentation, I would like to mention other language which I am good at to the extent that I can peer review projects. In addition to Python, I can do in **C** as well.
