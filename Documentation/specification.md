# The Project Specification
Last modified: *14.01.2025*

My name is Yuki Yotsumoto. I belong to **Bachelor of Science in Computer Science** (CS) as an exchange student from Japan. All the project's documentation are written in **English markdown** (.md) language.

## Programming language used in this project
I would like to code with **Python** language in this project this time because it should be easy for many computer engineers to understand, given its easy grammar rule [1] and its popularity.

And as mentioned on the page of the course's details on other documentation, I would like to mention other language which I am good at to the extent that I can peer review projects. In addition to Python, I can do in **C** as well.

## What problem am I solving?
I would like to name this project **GRASP**.
I define GRASP as the term standing for 
**G**raphically **R**ecognizable **A**nalysis **S**ystem for **P**rogramming. 

In computer science, in general, a growing use of program analysis is in the verification of properties of software used in safety-critical computer systems and locating potentially vulnerable code [2]. But GRASP is *for beginners, rather than for security reasons*.

If the code you have written does not produce expected results, you need to grasp what is wrong.  
For example,  
- how in order program works
- what kind of number each of variables has
- which route is selected in conditioal branching.

Therefore, I focus on tahe fact that it's difficult for programming beginner to clarify the cause of some errors in program.
