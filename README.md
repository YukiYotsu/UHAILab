# 👋 Moi!
I'm Yuki Yotsumoto. This is the README markdown for the AI Lab course at the University of Helsinki 🇫🇮 in 2025.

## List of used main technique

## How to start my App  
### How to do setting  
The newer Poetry should be maintained by Homebrew. So you cannot use:
```
poetry shell

The command "shell" does not exist.
```  
After **cloning** my repository on your machine, **launch** Poetry at the root directory of the installed project.
To implement this, you have to install Poetry in advance.
Finish the initialization of the project by running the command:  
```
poetry install
```  
When executing the command, you might be led to the following notification:  
```  
Installing the current project: poetry-testi (0.1.0)
The current project could not be installed: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '~/poetry-testi/README.md'
If you do not want to install the current project use --no-root
```  
This is because Poetry is also trying to install (some) existing projects here. When you want to install only project dependencies, use this:  
```  
poetry install --no-root
```  
### How to install *customtkinter* in Poetry?  
My App uses 'CustomTkinter' library which is made based on UI-library 'Tkinter', which helps the project **generate UI**. So execute the command below to use my project (after moving to the root directory):  
`poetry add --dev customtkinter` 

And you will get the notification:
```
Updating dependencies
Resolving dependencies... (0.6s)

Package operations: 3 installs, 0 updates, 0 removals

  - Installing darkdetect (0.8.0)
  - Installing packaging (24.2)
  - Installing customtkinter (5.2.2)

Writing lock file
``` 
This is finally completion of installing. How to use this? It is explained on [the page](https://customtkinter.tomschimansky.com/tutorial/).  

~~My application uses 'tkinter' library which help the project generate GUI.~~  

**Move** to the directory named 'GRASP' with ```cd ``` command and **Start** the application with the command:  
```  
poetry run python __main__.py
```  
The new window (my project's App) appears.  
### How to implement coverage
To update (generate lock file):  
```  
poetry add requests
```  
If you have not installed coverage, use the command:  
```  
poetry add --dev coverage
```  
**Move** to 'tests' directory and **Execute** coverage test:  
```  
poetry run coverage run test_prime.py
```  
And then, you will get the report using:  
```  
poetry run coverage report
```  
For example;  
```  
takumi@takuminoMacBook-Pro Tests % poetry run coverage
 report
Name                                                       Stmts   Miss  Cover

```  

## Directory structure  
All the documents are stored in the same directory named "Documentation".  
All the files should not be changed for stable implementing.

## Trouble Shooting
#### What is 'Programming_vocabulary.csv'?  
It is used as the sample vocabulary to compare target words with rightly-spelled words.  
#### In the case where you want to use shell **mandatorily**.  
I have not tried this, but just in case.  
First, install plugin:  
```
poetry self add poetry-plugin-shell
```
But you might receieve error. If so, the cause should be 'The ```shell``` command was moved to a plugin: ```poetry-plugin-shell```, Poetry official page said [4].  
You can install poetry with *pip* to solve this error, you should not use pip though according to the course page.
> Varoitus: pip
Olet saattanut asentaa Pythonin tarvitsemia riippuvuuksia pip-komennolla. Älä käytä pipiä tällä kurssilla sillä jos teet niin, teet 99.9% todennäköisyydellä jotain väärin.  
#### How to use 'tkinter' which is a *former* GUI library for my project.  
My application used to import 'tkinter' library which help the project **generate GUI**. So execute the command below to use my project:
```
brew install python-tk
```
You will get the answer like the following one: 
```

~~**Where and What is the function named "connectiontest"?**  
It is used only for confirming the stable connection between files placed at some different folders. "connectiontest" is (or used to be) set in "```__main__.py```".~~
